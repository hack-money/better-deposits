### What is a smart contract?

A smart contract is a piece of software that acts according to a set of pre-programmed rules. They are immutable (their code and rules
cannot be changed once deployed), always on 24/7, and are able to store and manipulate money. They are deployed on the Ethereum blockchain.

### How can this be trustless?

It is the smart contract that holds your funds and acts on the funds according to the escrow rules you setup. This means that you're not trusting an individual or company to hold the deposit, rather you rely on immutable, always-on and permissionless code. However, this is currently alpha software and not ready for real use. Better Deposits, at the moment, is a priviledged actor has various admin priviledges.

### What is DeFi?

lending, borrowing and insurance amongst other common financial activities. Better Deposits uses this to generate passive interest on your escrowed deposit.

Security is a core focus for the development of the software. However, this is currently alpha software and not yet ready for real use.

### Isn't crypto volatile? Won't my deposit fluctuate in value?

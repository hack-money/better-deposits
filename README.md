Trustless, interest bearing rental tenancy deposits. Deployed at: https://betterdeposits.com/ 

Better Deposits is financial software that allows funds to be escrowed in a smart contract. Two parties are involved in the escrow, whom decide on the funds to be locked, the duration and the identity of a third party adjudicator. The locked funds are deposited in a DeFi money market protocol to earn passive interest. 

At the end of the tenancy, the parties either approve the release of the deposit or call a dispute. In the case of a dispute, the deposit is forwarded to the third party adjudicator.
